# learnRN
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chxin/learnRN.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chxin/learnRN)
This respository is created for my daily learning of React-Native base on the book "React Native   跨平台移动应用开发". I will type almost all the code list in the book to enhance my comprehense of RN.

The structure of this respository is a list of every module of RN. I will mkdir for every new module and improt these in index.js in the root dir.

All the modules which I try to use with the latest version is configurede in the package.json in the root dir.
